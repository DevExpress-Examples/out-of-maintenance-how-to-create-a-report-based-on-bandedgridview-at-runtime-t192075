' How to convert an XtraGrid to an XtraReport at runtime
' 
' This example demonstrates how to dynamically create a report based upon the
' GridControl at runtime. This means that all filtering and sorting conditions
' selected in the grid are also applied in a report. To accomplish this task, it
' is necessary to create a report with all the necessary bands, bind it to a data
' source and adjust all the necessary options.
'
